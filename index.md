### Introduction 

By 1720 in the aftermath of the War of Spanish Succession, Great Britain was an empire on the rise thanks to its successful war-time endeavors. The state’s military success was arguably the result of its uncanny ability to finance wars. As Britain basked in financial and military success, the underlying stability of its financial system loomed large. Government officials searched for financial innovations to relieve the burden of Britain’s debt. They sought to transfer the government’s debt to private institutions like the Bank of England and the South Sea Company who put forth competitive offers to finance the country’s debt. Implicit in the stock issue was an ingrained perception that rising prices would lift the fortunes of both the company and the national treasury. Only a few officials in the Bank of England warned of the unsustainable speculation, hinting at the eventual crash. In the aftermath of the collapse of the South Sea stock, men of considerable public credit and stature, like Sir John Eyles of the East India Company, were brought to restore equilibrium. To combat a dire financial situation, a well-intentioned man like Sir John Eyles found himself engaging in deceitful practices and questionable means. As exemplified by “A Letter to Sir John Eyles,” the complex if incoherent response to the crash underscored how cunning tactics and a lack of transparency—traits that led to the crisis—were central to achieving financial stability in 18th century financial systems. 

In the midst of the financial revolution of the 18th century, “London was possessed by an urge to make money.” That is, people began to substitute away from land and into shares and bonds. Stocks promised a convenient way to secure and grow an investment so much so that speculation often came hand in hand with the creation of these companies. Founded in 1711, the South Sea Company took advantage of shifting economic trends and capitalized on the public’s desire to invest. Not only were the wealthy investing in stocks, but a wider share of the public had access to a broad array of information. News was no longer the commodity of the wealthy and well connected. By 1695, Londoners had an option of at least five different tri-weekly newspapers. A proliferation of financial news created an appetite for information and stocks. Rags to riches stories, together with belief of inexhaustible riches in the Spanish colonies which the South Sea Company had an alleged monopoly on, fueled a frenzy to  purchase shares of the joint-stock company. 

This sentiment was exacerbated when the British government handed over its growing war debt to the South Sea Company in 1720. Looking to reduce the financial burden accumulated during a series of wars in the 17th century, the British Treasury allowed holders of its debt to exchange government securities for an equivalent sum in shares of the South Sea company. Central to this scheme was the belief that prices of the share would increase, leaving the British Treasury with less debt and its creditors content with a valuable asset. The allure of making a considerable sum of money from very little infected all facets of society. Rumor and innuendo on Exchange Street, where stocks traded, dominated public conversation. Not surprisingly, news of the new scheme increased speculation and sent the stock soaring from £300 in April, 1720 to £1,000 by August, 1720. Historian Charles MacKay aptly captures the atmosphere: “the speculating frenzy had seized them as well as the plebeians...It seemed at that time if the whole nation had turned stock-jobbers. Everybody came to purchase stock.” Implicit in the bidding up of the stock was a hysteria driven by greed and desire to make money. Not only was this craze driven by public action, but the directors of the company kept issuing stock and promised the stability of the company when it was teetering on collapse. A crash was looming in the horizon.

### The Crisis, Sir John Eyles, and the Response:


In January of 1720, the price of the South Sea Company stock dropped from £1,000 to £100. Many lost everything: the consequences were devastating for institutions and individuals alike. In response, Parliament launched a formal investigation of the matter. The role of every director was examined and many were stripped of large proportions of their wealth. Some were even arrested. Parliament appointed a set of new directors, which included Sir John Eyles, who was formerly a director of the Bank of England and East India Company. Many English were rightfully angry at the rampant speculation and fraudulent behavior of the directors. 
The anger is clearly seen in a “A Letter to Sir John Eyles, Bart. Sub Governor of the South Sea Company” signed anonymously, AB, and circulated in January of 1722. AB’s letter was written in response to another pamphlet titled, “A Letter to Sir John Eyles, from Gentlemen at Windsor” that criticizes and questions Eyle’s integrity. Though the identity of AB is unknown, he seems familiar with the work and dealings of Eyles and the South Sea Company enough to defend him. AB regards himself as “the Father and Protector of many thousand Proprietors of many Million” and a “sufferer of this unhappy Company” so he must be an investor or employee of the South Sea Company. He is extremely loyal to Eyles and wants to ensure that the claims against him are ridiculous. Though the letter is addressed to Eyles, it is not a personal letter; a personal letter at this time would most likely have been handwritten and the presence of a cover page and docket-title indicates the letters intent for circulation. Therefore, the letter is part of a larger debate regarding the crisis, its causes, who is to blame, and how it should be remedied. The appearances of this debate in the public is remarkable and indicative of an increasing public accountability of the management of financial crises. The aftermath of the crash revealed the large role played by the public in reacting to a crisis, through institutions like Parliament and newspapers.



Although the 18th century was a century of information democratization was the increase in participation of people in the stock market there was no regulation or checks in the system that prevented fradulent and corrupt behavior. The law did not protect anyone especially those who were swindled. False pretences was not an offence in England until 1757 (Carswell 12). This not only facillitated corrupt behavior, but also brought up the question of who is held responsible when thousands fall prey. Some like Lord Chief Justice Holt argued that blame lies in the individual who falls for the trap. As he is quoted saying, “shall we indict one man for making a fool of another?” (Carswell 12). Adam Smith would later explain bubbles as unstable inn in response to the 1772 Credit Crisis. Many know the house is unstable, but believe that can get out before the house falls, but the house ends up falling on someone. Everyone thinks that they can get out before 
“Wise in their own conceit, they imagined they could avoid faults, carry on their schemes for ever, and stretch the cord of credit to its extremist tension, without causing it to snap asunder.” (Extraordinary Popular Delusions pg. 47)
